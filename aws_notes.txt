Region -> Availability zones -> Data centers

# AWS Regions
- Regions are all around the world
example:
us-east-1, ap-east-1

- region is a cluster of data centers
- chosing a region depends on: proximity, compliance, availablity services, pricing


# AWS Availability Zones
- each region has many availability zones - min 2, max 6
- example:
region "ap-southeast-2" has 3 availability zones:
 ap-southeast-2a
 ap-southeast-2b
 ap-southeast-2c

- each availability zone can have more than 1 data centers
- each availability zone is separate from each other isolated from disasters
- each availability zone is connected with each other with high bw, ultra-low latency nw


# AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)
- special locations with lower latency service


# AWS Global services
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Route 53 (DNS service)
- CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)

# Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
- Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
- Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
- Lambda (Function as a Service)
- Rekognition (Software as a Service)

# to check which services are available at a region, use this link:
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/

# AWS management console
- login
- search Route 53 (Global service)
- EC2 (region scoped and not global)

##############
# IAM Section
##############
Identity and Access Management
- IAM is a global service - thus does not require region selection
- however EC2 is region-scoped service - requires region selection
